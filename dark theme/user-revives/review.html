                        <p>Employees usually see cybersecurity measures as interfering with their daily work. By involving employees in the review, you can speed up the process and show them why it’s important. For example, you can send out lists of access rights to users and their managers and ask them to point out what resources they no longer need to access.</p>

                        <p>Communicating with employees is vital for cybersecurity. If employees don’t understand why it’s important to implement a certain practice or use a specific tool, there’s a high chance they’ll find a way not to comply. That’s why you need to communicate the principles and importance of access management to your employees during cybersecurity training.</p>

                            This principle dictates that users should have access to data only if they absolutely need it. The fewer privileges a user has, the less time you need to spend reviewing them. The principle of least privilege is required by security standards we’ve discussed earlier.</p>
